## Project Structure

The project follows a modular and clean hierarchy:

* `src/lib.rs`: The primary entry point that manages public module exports.
* `src/array_string.rs`: Defines the hierarchy for array and string related problems.
* `src/array_string/merge_strings_alternately.rs`: Contains the logic and unit tests for the specific algorithm.

## Testing Strategy

This project adheres to Rust's best practices for testing:

* **Unit Tests**: Located within each source file to verify internal logic and edge cases, such as strings of different lengths.
* **Integration Tests**: Stored in the `/tests` directory to ensure the library works correctly when imported as an external crate.
